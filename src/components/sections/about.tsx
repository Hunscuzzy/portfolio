            Driven by a passion for entrepreneurship since the age of 17, I am a
            28-year-old husband and father, based in Spain. My career,
            predominantly as a front-end developer, showcases a deep commitment
            to leveraging my skills in React.js, Typescript and other modern
            technologies to create user-friendly and efficient interfaces with
            10 years of self-learning experiences under my belt.
            <br />

            Currently employed at Purse and with a valuable stint at
            Upstreampay, my focus is not just on coding but on learning and
            growing with each project. I am always eager to embrace new
            challenges, and I am committed to using my knowledge to help others
            and push the limits of web technology, all while maintaining a
            human-centered approach in my work.
